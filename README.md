3. run TNCounter.py
4. enjoy free sunstones (also the excel file have 'Extra Info' sheet for funnies)

# Known issues
- weapon & accessory counting, as well as some tower-specific items are not supported yet
- might have some inaccuracies
- probably useless since the item catalog is implemented in the official game
- doesn't work for non-python users since idk how to make an exe file :(

# Plans
- count more stuff (dig blocks, key blocks, enemies)
- have an extra sheet dedicated to weapon/accessories
- or abandon the project entirely idk
